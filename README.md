## Summary

This project predicts cabin prices using a basic neural network model. It uses features like size, number of rooms, sauna size, and distances to lakes and neighbors. A forward-pass through the network calculates an estimated cabin price. This is part of the Building AI course.

## Project Title

my-ai-project

## Description

This project demonstrates how a simple neural network can be used to predict the price of a cabin using a predefined set of weights and inputs. The goal is to understand the flow of data through the layers using ReLU and identity activation functions.

## Files Included

- `README.md`: This file, describes the idea and project goal.
- `main.py`: A simple Python implementation of the forward-pass logic.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
