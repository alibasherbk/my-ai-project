## Summary

This project predicts cabin prices using a basic neural network model. It uses features like size, number of rooms, sauna size, and distances to lakes and neighbors. A forward-pass through the network calculates an estimated cabin price using ReLU and identity activation functions. This is a submission for the Building AI course.

## Description

This project demonstrates how a simple feedforward neural network can be used to predict cabin prices. The network includes:

- An input layer with 5 features (size, rooms, sauna, lake distance, neighbor distance)
- Two hidden layers using ReLU activation
- An output layer using identity activation

The goal is to simulate a prediction pipeline and understand forward propagation in a minimal neural network.
