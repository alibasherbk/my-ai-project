# my-ai-project

## Summary

This project predicts cabin prices using a simple neural network. The model takes inputs like size, number of rooms, sauna size, and distances, and outputs a predicted price. This is a submission for the Building AI course by the University of Helsinki.

## Description

The neural network has:
- An input layer with 5 features
- Two hidden layers using ReLU activation
- An output layer with identity activation

The project is coded in Python using NumPy and focuses on demonstrating a basic forward-pass in a feedforward network.
